From the time Keller takes her morning walk along the 1,000-foot handrail around her yard through her workday to her nightly reading of her Braille Bible, her serene acceptance of her life will amaze and inspire.","release_date":"1954-06-15","genres":[],"vote_average":8.0,"runtime":55,"cert":"N\/A","id":114500,"title":"Helen Keller in Her Story","adult":false},{"cast":["Fredric March","Albert Schweitzer","Phillip Eckert","Adele Woytt","Burgess Meredith"],"overview":"This biographical drama\/part-time documentary, narrative written by Dr. Albert Schweitzer and spoken by Frederic March, traces the life of Dr. Schweitzer (with actors playing the characters), from his birth in France up to about the age of 30 when he makes the decision to go to French Equatorial Africa and build his jungle hospital.
