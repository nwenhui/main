How can he get out of it? On the advice of Wes, the out-and-proud best man, he pretends to be gay and gets caught kissing Wes. Little does Jake realize he's about to get caught up in a circle of jealousy and lies. Cliff, the groom, is getting married to help solidify his hunky, soap opera star image... and to stay closeted. Yep, he s gay. And his longtime boyfriend is none other than his best man. When Cliff and Wes get pictures taken of them in a compromising position (several, in fact) it looks as though his cover might be blown. Thrown into the mix is the bride's sex crazy mother and the nosy reporter-turned-wedding photographer with a sock puppet (pop icon Deborah Gibson).
