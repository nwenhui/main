The staging is effective--the complicated counterpoint of the ensembles is reflected in unobtrusive blocking that keeps the vocal lines clear and separate, especially in the final fugue. Bryn Terfel's Falstaff is a memorable creation, self-mocking and self-aggrandising at the same time--so much so, in fact, that he almost does not need the vast prosthetic body he has to wear for the part. Desiree Rancatore is an admirably sweet-toned Nanetta; Bernadette Manca di Nissa an appropriately sardonic Mistress Quickly; Roberto Frontali as Ford, in his Act 2 scena, perfectly distils and parodies every jealousy aria ever written, including Verdi's own. Haitink's conducting is exemplary in the lyrical passages, gets almost everything out of the fast and furious comic sections.","release_date":"2000-07-06","genres":[35,10402],"vote_average":0.0,"runtime":139,"cert":"","id":240782,"title":"Falstaff","adult":false},{"cast":["Peyton Welch","Daphne Gere","Georgia Denney","Linda Coleman","Micah Mernika"],"overview":"A boy named Charlie Rockit needs $50,000 to fix his aunt and uncle's tractor engine, so Chuck E. and friends go to the Galaxy 5000 to win it in a race.","release_date":"1999-10-05","genres":[10751,10402],"vote_average":0.0,"runtime":60,"cert":"N\/A","id":240793,"title":"Chuck E.
