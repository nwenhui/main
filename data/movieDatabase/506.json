[{"cast":["Tara Frederick","Aloka McLean","R. H. Thomson","Sheila McCarthy","Andrea Libman"],"overview":"Set off the West Coast of Canada in 1965, a hip new teacher with a miniskirt and lots of ideas turns a small town upside down.  The soft autumn light of Galiano Island is beautifully rendered in writer\/producer Peggy Thompson's The Lotus Eaters, and that's not the only elusive element that this film has captured.  In revisiting its particular time and place - the Gulf Islands of the early '60s -Thompson obviously draws on her own family experiences there.  For those who share Thompson's love of Gulf Islands magic, the elements she has assembled will feel as familiar as their own childhood blanket.  But there are problems at the core of this story about a family's loss of innocence.","release_date":"1993-09-12","genres":[18,35],"vote_average":7.0,"runtime":101,"cert":"N\/A","id":252501,"title":"The Lotus Eaters","adult":false},{"cast":[],"overview":"A group of monkeys doing some mischief in the city.","release_date":"2012-10-17","genres":[],"vote_average":7.0,"runtime":1,"cert":"N\/A","id":252503,"title":"Monkey City","adult":false},{"cast":["Alan Tang","Simon Yam","Brigitte Lin","Tony Leung Ka-Fai","Yuen Wah"],"overview":"A group of specialists are recruited to steal from a police station.","release_date":"1993-11-18","genres":[28,14,35,80],"vote_average":5.3,"runtime":91,"cert":"N\/A","id":252505,"title":"The Black Panther Warriors","adult":false},{"cast":["Jaroslav Marvan","Oldřich Nový","Josef Bek","Alena Vránová","František Kovářík"],"overview":"","release_date":"1955-05-27","genres":[35,10402],"vote_average":5.4,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":252510,"title":"Hudba z Marsu","adult":false},{"cast":["Ben Stiller","Naomi Watts","Adam Driver","Amanda Seyfried","Charles Grodin"],"overview":"An uptight documentary filmmaker and his wife find their lives loosened up a bit after befriending a free-spirited younger couple.","release_date":"2015-04-03","genres":[35,18,9648],"vote_average":5.9,"runtime":97,"cert":"15","id":252512,"title":"While We're Young","adult":false},{"cast":["Girt Bolo","Kristie Stoffel"],"overview":"A surreal retelling of Homer's \"The Odyssey\" set in late '90s Seattle.","release_date":"","genres":[],"vote_average":0.0,"runtime":92,"cert":"N\/A","id":252514,"title":"Toast with the Gods","adult":false},{"cast":["Tom Steele","Louise Currie","Johnny Arthur","William Forrest","Anthony Warde"],"overview":"A team of two-fisted insurance investigators (one of whom disguises himself as The Masked Marvel)  endeavor to discover and thwart the loathsome saboteur Sakima.","release_date":"1943-11-06","genres":[28],"vote_average":2.8,"runtime":197,"cert":"N\/A","id":252516,"title":"The Masked Marvel","adult":false},{"cast":[],"overview":"Six girls coming of age, ready to become something extraordinary.","release_date":"2013-08-28","genres":[99],"vote_average":5.5,"runtime":88,"cert":"N\/A","id":252518,"title":"I Am a Girl","adult":false},{"cast":[],"overview":"A four-film omnibus  that features four short anime films all themed around Japan.","release_date":"2013-07-20","genres":[16],"vote_average":6.9,"runtime":68,"cert":"N\/A","id":252520,"title":"Short Peace","adult":false},{"cast":["Jade Chou","Cheng Ping Chou","Nur Najman Ade Putra"],"overview":"Debbie used to live on a coffee farm in Indonesia and dreamed about becoming a barista.
