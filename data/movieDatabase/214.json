THE DEATHLESS DEVIL introduces us to a young man (Kunt Tulgar) who discovers that he was adopted, and that his father was really a superhero named Copperhead. Like anyone who finds out such blood runs in his veins, he dons the Copperhead mask and goes into action. First on his list is the nefarious, mustached Dr. Satan, who has plans to steal technology that will let him control the world's robots and electronics. This technology belongs to a kindly professor and his pretty daughter, whose safety is now in Copperhead's hands. As he fights to bring the villain down, he finds time to enjoy the numerous Turkish beauties who disrobe for him.","release_date":"1973-05-15","genres":[35,28,878],"vote_average":4.5,"runtime":84,"cert":"N\/A","id":106914,"title":"The Deathless Devil","adult":false},{"cast":["Paolo Gozlino","Claudie Lange","Ivano Staccioli","Jack Ary","Micaela Pignatelli"],"overview":"Though set in England, Flashman is another fun Italian production from the late 60s that leans on -attempted- humor and is heavily inspired by Batman.

This film is low-budget, and if that's a plus for you, check it out. The sets are wonderful and the special effects are very funny (the dwarves are regular-sized actors, shot from above). Most of the effects involve optical-printing, which wasn't done very skillfully, so the sequences are a little out of focus. Nevertheless, this is one of the most entertaining kung-fu movies I've ever seen.
