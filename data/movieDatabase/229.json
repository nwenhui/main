Kutz used the film to explore new formal solutions, collaborating closely with cinematographer Jerzy Wojcik to reveal the psychological landscape of a pair of lovers who are strongly affected by wartime events. The camera recorded the couple's inner experiences, contrasting their muted intimacy against the surrounding scenery of a ruined town. The film did not win over critics at the time of its release. It was not until later that critics recognized Kutz's effort to experiment with aesthetics in a manner akin to that pursued by filmmakers of the new wave. NOBODY'S CALLING came to be compared with Michelangelo Antonioni's THE ADVENTURE, which was produced around the same time.","release_date":"1960-10-31","genres":[10752,18,10749],"vote_average":5.7,"runtime":86,"cert":"N\/A","id":114001,"title":"Nobody's Calling","adult":false},{"cast":["Jack Scalia","Jeremy Luc","Joseph Russo","Daniel Booko","Alex Mauriello"],"overview":"Many years ago, hundreds of locals and tourists were massacred by giant man-eating sharks in the infamous 1916 Jersey Shore attacks.
