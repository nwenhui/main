For more than a year, the uno bianca gang - they always use a white Fiat Uno - has plagued the area. Their crimes are violent, sometimes killing carabineri, and there's no particular pattern: a bank one day, a petrol station the next, extortion of a small business the next. Are they terrorists? A foreign gang? Tied to the Mafia? After a particularly bloody shootout, two detectives are assigned to start fresh: they go through the notebooks of previous investigators and they interview a few witnesses again. They find a pattern in the crimes and predict the next assault, but the special task force in Bologna is dismissive. Can they carry on alone; how far will they get?","release_date":"2001-02-05","genres":[80,28,53],"vote_average":6.3,"runtime":190,"cert":"N\/A","id":130492,"title":"Uno bianca","adult":false},{"cert":"N\/A","title":"Metallica: Live in Den Bosch","cast":[],"genres":[],"id":130494,"overview":"Holland, 1992.
