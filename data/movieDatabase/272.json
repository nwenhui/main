Typical of extravagant D'Annunzian aestheticism at its height, Rapsodia Satanica was one of the summits of what was later called the \"tail coat film.\" Diametrically opposed to the \"cinema of reality\" practiced by Serena, Martoglio and others, \"tail coat films\" set their melodramatic stories in the salons and villas of the upper middle class and the aristocracy, deploying narrative structures contrived to showcase their actors and especially its actresses. This had the effect of accentuating their physical presence and turning them into stars - probably the first stars in movie history. The success of the \"dive\" contributed to the development of motion picture grammar in its special use of the close-up.","release_date":"1917-07-31","genres":[9648,18,14,27],"vote_average":6.3,"runtime":55,"cert":"N\/A","id":135551,"title":"Satan's Rhapsody","adult":false},{"cast":["John McKay","Linda Ormond","Monica Davis","Clyde Kelly","Darlene Myrick"],"overview":"A voodoo priestess sends out zombies to bring back live victims for her sacrificial rituals.","release_date":"1961-01-01","genres":[27],"vote_average":2.0,"runtime":71,"cert":"N\/A","id":135559,"title":"The Dead One","adult":false},{"cast":["Walderrama Dos Santos","Kika de Oliveira","Markus Konká","Ricardo Araújo","Marcelo Castanheira"],"overview":"In a polluted mangrove swamp, dead bodies raise during the night, attacking and biting the dwellers that transform into aggressive zombies.
