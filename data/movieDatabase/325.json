History informs these films in a big way, with the voiceover narration (which incorporates excerpts from various authors) introducing tension between the images of the modern-day city and the descriptions of incidents from its long and rich history.  Istanbul is probably the most conventional documentary of Pialat's Turkish series, providing a general profile of the titular city, its different neighborhoods, and the different cultures and ways of living that coexist within its sprawling borders. As the other films in the series also suggest, Pialat sees Turkey, and Istanbul in particular, as a junction point between Europe and the East, between the old and the new, between history and modernity.","release_date":"1964-01-01","genres":[99],"vote_average":6.5,"runtime":13,"cert":"N\/A","id":162348,"title":"Istanbul","adult":false},{"cast":["André Reybaz"],"overview":"Maître Galip is the most poetic and powerful of Pialat's Turkish Chronicles, using the poems of Nazim Hikmet to accompany a series of evocative images of ordinary working class people in Istanbul. This was the film that Pialat himself claimed was the most complete realization of what he was aiming for with his Turkish documentaries. It's not difficult to see why this was his favorite: here he abandons the historical commentary and documentary observation of the other shorts in favor of an emotional emphasis on the lives of the poor and the unemployed.A short doc by Maurice Pialat.","release_date":"1964-01-01","genres":[99],"vote_average":6.3,"runtime":11,"cert":"N\/A","id":162350,"title":"Maître Galip","adult":false},{"cast":[],"overview":"Short documentary film directed by James Algar.

As a contrast against Istanbul's status as a center of historical religious conflict, Pialat \u2014 drawing here on texts by the French poet Gérard de Nerval \u2014 also describes the city as a place of strange ethnic and religious harmony, with representatives of various cultures and religions living in close contact. He emphasizes the city's hybrid culture, its blend of Southern European and Arab influences, reflected in both its people and its very construction.","release_date":"1964-01-01","genres":[99],"vote_average":5.8,"runtime":12,"cert":"N\/A","id":162354,"title":"Golden Horn","adult":false},{"cast":["Christiane Paul","Senta Berger","Katharina M.

The worried parents call the other three adult daughters into the house and they arrive one by one. For the first time in 6 years the entire family is united again. The characters are drawn as tensions rise from old conflicts and as the situation sinks in that Laura might be terminally ill. The movie eventually shifts from a lively sometimes comical beginning into the serious theme of dying and does handle this quite tactfully and moving. While the film touches on many areas surrounding death (including religion, graveyard, care, eutanasia) the main focus is on the transformation of the characters that are thrown out of their busy lifes into this situation, eventually accepting it and dealing with it.","release_date":"2009-12-09","genres":[18,35],"vote_average":0.0,"runtime":null,"cert":"N\/A","id":162362,"title":"Ob ihr wollt oder nicht","adult":false},{"cast":[],"overview":"A short 6-minute essay-documentary by Maurice Pialat on the region in which much of the action of Nous ne vieillirons pas ensemble unfolds.","release_date":"1966-01-01","genres":[99],"vote_average":5.0,"runtime":6,"cert":"N\/A","id":162364,"title":"La Camargue","adult":false},{"cast":["Claude Dauphin"],"overview":"Oscar Winning 1948 short film by Alain Resnais, not to be confused with either the Short 1966 TV doc or the 1991 feature film by Maurice Pialat, both of which shared the same name.","release_date":"1948-01-01","genres":[],"vote_average":6.0,"runtime":20,"cert":"N\/A","id":162366,"title":"Van Gogh","adult":false},{"cast":["Marco Paoletti","Juanjo Menéndez","Juana Cáceres"],"overview":"","release_date":"1959-11-16","genres":[18,35],"vote_average":6.0,"runtime":114,"cert":"N\/A","id":162368,"title":"El Lazarillo de Tormes","adult":false},{"cast":["Alberto Sordi","Gunilla Elm-Tornkvist","Anne-Charlotte Sjöberg","Barbro Wastenson","Monica Wastenson"],"overview":"An Italian fur merchant who is going to Sweden for the first time to attend the annual fur auctions in Stockholm.
