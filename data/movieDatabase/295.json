He finds it, under a hibernating bear (\"So I laid an egg\"), but a wolf has followed him in and snatches the egg, with some help from a stick of TNT. What the wolf hasn't counted on is mama, who's right behind him, with a couple of eye-poking fingers at the ready. The wolf swaps a doorknob for the egg, and starts boiling the egg, but mama arrives in the nick of time only to be rejected by the baby, who was just getting warm.","release_date":"1944-10-14","genres":[16],"vote_average":6.3,"runtime":7,"cert":"N\/A","id":147003,"title":"Booby Hatched","adult":false},{"cast":[],"overview":"The horrific war in Chechnya, a neighbor of Georgia, gives a special poignancy to Otar Iosseliani\u2019s fascinating, four-hour, made-for-television documentary on Georgia which, like his delightful Chasing Butterflies (SFIFF 1993), was produced in France.
