He spent his life in pursuit of the ideal of beauty, an ideal that found expression in three of the most extraordinary, ornate architectural schemes imaginable - the castle of Neuschwanstein and the palaces of Linderhof and Herrenchiemsee. Today, these three buildings are among Germany's biggest tourist attractions.  Dan Cruickshank explores the rich aesthetic of Ludwig II - from the mock-medievalism of Neuschwanstein, the iconic fairytale castle that became the inspiration for the one in Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty, to the rich Baroque splendour of Herrenchiemsee, Ludwig's answer to Versailles. Dan argues that Ludwig's castles are more than flamboyant kitsch and are, in fact, the key to unravelling the eternal enigma of Ludwig II.","release_date":"2013-07-02","genres":[36,99],"vote_average":0.0,"runtime":59,"cert":"","id":244002,"title":"The Fairytale Castles of King Ludwig II","adult":false},{"cast":["Lisa Gerstein","Chris Enright","Greg Cruikshank","Beth Allen","Marny Snyder Spoons"],"overview":"A high schooler from suburbia gets in touch with her sexuality while working at a dingy movie theater in the city.","release_date":"1998-03-22","genres":[35,18],"vote_average":9.0,"runtime":95,"cert":"N\/A","id":244007,"title":"Mary Jane's Not a Virgin Anymore","adult":false},{"cast":["Robin King","adam mclean"],"overview":"A short film by Robert Morgan","release_date":"2013-05-06","genres":[16,14,27],"vote_average":6.2,"runtime":3,"cert":"","id":244009,"title":"Invocation","adult":false},{"cast":[],"overview":"The film shows one day from waking up in the morning all the way to waking up again the next morning.
