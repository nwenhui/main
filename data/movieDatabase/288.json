Like some of the other flicks Wong had his name on (Eighth Happiness, All's Well Ends Well), In-Laws, Out-Laws centers on family hijinks, and is generally steeped in cultural mores which may lose some Western audiences. However, unlike those films, In-Laws, Out-Laws has extra source material: it was based on a hit Guangzhou television show, which means an extra layer of cultural specificity which might make the film even more inaccessible to Western audiences. Another major difference: most of the cast members of this film are generally not \"names\" in the Hong Kong entertainment circle. Also, the movie is really not very good, though that's not really a function of the above-named differences. It's just the way things are.","release_date":"2004-01-08","genres":[],"vote_average":0.0,"runtime":100,"cert":"N\/A","id":143984,"title":"In-Laws, Out-Laws","adult":false},{"cert":"N\/A","title":"Autumn Sun","cast":["Norma Aleandro","Federico Luppi"],"genres":[],"id":143989,"overview":"Clara Goldstein is a lovely, middle-aged Jewish woman who, because of an impending visit from her American brother, is forced to create a contrived relationship with a man of her own faith.
