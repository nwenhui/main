Award-winning filmmaker Rick McKay filmed over 100 of the greatest stars ever to work on Broadway or in Hollywood.  He soon learned that great films can be restored, fine literature can be kept in print - but historic Broadway performances of the past are the most endangered.  They leave only memories that, while more vivid, are more difficult to preserve.  In their own words - and not a moment too soon - Broadway: The Golden Age tells the stories of our theatrical legends, how they came to New York, and how they created this legendary century in American theatre.  This is the largest cast of legends ever in one film.","release_date":"2003-01-01","genres":[10402,99,36],"vote_average":4.5,"runtime":111,"cert":"N\/A","id":100842,"title":"Broadway: The Golden Age","adult":false},{"cast":["Anthony Pappalardo","Anthony Van Engelen","Brian Wenning","Danny Garcia","Danny Renaud"],"overview":"The editing and filming techniques used are some of the most artistic and original in the industry through many different eyes.
