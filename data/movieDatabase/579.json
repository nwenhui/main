At a fancy-dress ball, when Ray wears a costume made of newspaper headlines concerning her arrest, Egypt is offended. Seen constantly in the company of Reverend Lodge, her reputation causes church people to take up the matter with the bishop. Leaving the country club, Egypt goes to the Lodge home and hides behind the door when the bishop arrives; Reverend Lodge wants to marry her, and they admit their love; but humiliation causes her to leave with Sturgis that night. Their yacht is wrecked, but Lodge and the bishop follow and rescue Egypt, though Sturgis is drowned. The bishop, realizing the depth of their love, consents to marry them.","release_date":"1927-03-21","genres":[10749,18],"vote_average":5.7,"runtime":70,"cert":"N\/A","id":289380,"title":"Sensation Seekers","adult":false},{"cast":["Eddie Cantor","Jobyna Ralston","William Powell","Mabel Julienne Scott","Jack Dougherty"],"overview":"The second and last of Eddie Cantor's silent vehicles, Special Delivery casts the wide-eyed comedian as a hapless mailman.
